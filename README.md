# Project #3: React Application

## Overview:

Your team will be creating a front end application using React.

**You will be working as a team for this project**, everyone must contribute.  If 1 person does not contribute or 1 person does all the work then the entire team will fail the project requirements.  If you pair program then please include the other persons github name in the commit.

## What You've Learned

By the time you submit this project, you will have covered new ground in, and reviewed, many of the big themes of the course so far:

- **Command Line**: Practice interacting with the computer and navigating the filesystem from the command line.
- **Source Control**: Manage and interact with a git repository to store changes to code.
- **Programming Fundamentals**: Work with objects, constructors, events, while learning how to strategically solve problems and resolve errors.
- **Web Fundamentals**: Learn how communication happens over the internet, and how to structure, style, and animate documents within a browser. Also learn how to respond to actions your users take and the data they input into the browser.
- **Browser Applications**: Dive into CSS, and figure out how to use libraries and frameworks to get lots of style and functionality for free.
- **Deployment**: Host a web application in a managed hosting environment.
- **Responsive Web Design**: Making web applications that respond to device size.
- **Server Side Applications**: Server-side scripting is a technique used in web development which involves employing scripts on a web server which produce a response customized for each user's (client's) request to the website.
- **Databases**: A structured set of data held in a computer, especially one that is accessible in various ways.
- **SQL**: SQL is used to communicate with a database. It is the standard language for relational database management systems. SQL statements are used to perform tasks such as update data on a database, or retrieve data from a database.
- **Ruby**: Ruby programming fundamentals including Object Oriented Programming with Classes and Inheritance.
- **Ruby on Rails**: A web-application framework that includes everything needed to create database-backed web applications according to the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern.
- **AJAX**: Using Axios to make asynchronous javascript calls.
- **APIs**: Communicating to an API using Axios to fetch data.
- **React**: A front end framework for building modern web applications.

## Requirements

- **Build a web application using create-react-app**.  Must be your own work.
- **Use React framework** to build your application with *at least* 
  - 4 components
  - 4 props
  - 2 state properties
  - 2 routes
  - 1 API call with Axios and display the data for the user.
- **Craft a `README.md` file that explains your app** to the world.
- **Recorded video demo** of your application to submit your project.

### Necessary Deliverables

Projects are due **Thursday, 11/7 at 10am**!  

Submissions will be submitted by posting into slack
- the recorded video demo 
- a link to your deployed application 
- a link to your github repository

The recorded video demo must be a **10-20 minute presentation** in which you answer the following questions:
  - What is the application about?
  - What are the user stories for your application?
  - What API did you choose to use?
  - Demo of the application
  - Walk through a piece of code
  - What was the most difficult part of the team project?
  - What was your favourite part of working on a team?
  - What would your team like to add next?
  
### Stretch Goals

>DO NOT attempt stretch goals until all MVP requirements have been met!

- Use more than 1 API
- Save data to localstorage or [firebase api (docs)](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/web/start) with [React (tutorial)](https://css-tricks.com/intro-firebase-react/)
- Use a React component library like [Ant Design](https://ant.design/docs/react/introduce), [Bootstrap React](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/), or [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/)
- Use a CSS library like [Bootstrap (tutorial)](https://m.pardel.net/react-and-bootstrap-4-part-1-setup-navigation-d4767e2ed9f0)
- Add User Sign Up, Sign In, and Sign Out with [Firebase and React Authentication (tutorial)](https://medium.com/firebase-developers/how-to-setup-firebase-authentication-with-react-in-5-minutes-maybe-10-bb8bb53e8834), alternative tutorial [here](https://css-tricks.com/firebase-react-part-2-user-authentication/) (can be very challenging)
